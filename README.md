# Easy React Posts

## Main features

In this app demo users can search posts by author, title and keyword.<br>
Sidebar options let users filter posts by date values.<br>
The function getPlaylist() in components/post.js when passed a post object returns a Spotify playlist from GIST JSON data.<br>
Pagination displays 10 posts per page by default but this can be customiseds.

## Handling the JSON data

In this demo I'm requesting the JSON data when the main component is mounted before enabling live search.<br>
Gists load pretty damn quick thanks to how Github serves user generated content.<br>
For a series of posts containing mostly text data this is fine but with a lot of images you may need to setup your asynchonous requests differently.

## Customising navigation

The disabled link shows a typical setup when we want show a client what search options premium users would have access to as part of their account. One might build out a login modal or popup to show this in action

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
